## Overview

This document provides guidelines and best practices for structuring and organizing
your codebase. It is divided into three main sections: Data, Domain, and Presenter layers. Each section contains
detailed instructions and examples to help you maintain a clean and modular codebase.

## Table of Contents

1. [Data Layer](doc/style/data.md)
2. [Domain Layer](doc/style/domain.md)
3. [Presenter Layer](doc/style/presenter.md)

## Data Layer

The Data Layer is responsible for managing the data of the application. It includes models, repositories, and data
sources. For detailed guidelines on how to structure the data layer, refer to the [Data Layer Guide](doc/style/data.md).

## Domain Layer

The Domain Layer contains the business logic of the application. It includes entities, use cases, and repository
interfaces. For detailed guidelines on how to structure the domain layer, refer to the [Domain Layer Guide](doc/style/domain.md).

## Presenter Layer

The Presenter Layer is responsible for presenting data to the user. It includes the presentation logic and state
management. For detailed guidelines on how to structure the presenter layer, refer to
the [Presenter Layer Guide](doc/style/presenter.md).

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Follow a consistent directory structure and naming convention across all layers.
- **Modularity**: Keep your code modular by separating concerns and using well-defined interfaces.
- **Documentation**: Include README files in each directory to provide context and documentation for each feature.
- **Testing**: Write unit, widget, and integration tests for each feature to ensure the reliability of your code.
